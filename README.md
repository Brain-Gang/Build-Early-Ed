# Build Early Ed.
Started as the capstone project for the Brain Trust team from Deep Dive Data Science Cohort 2 and bacame Build Early ed.

## About:
Build Early Ed. began as a data science project with a goal to use open datasets to identify which neighborhoods in NM were the most in need of a Head Start Center  (https://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/). Once we completed this study we decided to create a companion web app to share this information with the people of NM so that they can the nearest Head Start location,  see if they qualify for services, and if there is not a nearby location, use our site to gauge how likely their neighborhood is to qualify for a Head Start location and direct them to resources to apply for one.
