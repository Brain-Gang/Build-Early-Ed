This is a web application to connect New Mexicans to early childhood education opportunities. Using a map powered by data science, community members can identify their eligibility to enroll their child in Head Start or apply for grant funding for Head Start programs based on economic and demographic characteristics. Build Early Ed connects residents to opportunities to advance their career in early childhood education by centralizing academic and professional opportunities in the field. We also connect New Mexicans to local organizations and resources to support advocacy for early childhood education opportunities. Together, we can build a stronger continuum of care for youth in New Mexico.

## About
Build Early Ed began as a data science project with a goal to use open datasets to identify which neighborhoods in NM were underserved by and eligible for a Head Start Center (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dDkCk3ZhNk). We created a companion web app to share this information with the people of NM to identify the nearest Head Start location,  see if they qualify for services, and if there is not a nearby location, use our site to gauge how likely their neighborhood is to qualify for a Head Start location and direct them to resources to apply for one.
